<h1>Milestones</h1>
<p>postmarketOS aims to be like a typical Linux distribution - with lots of possibilities to choose from. And with a default selection of components, that are most useful to casual users.
This means, that there is no concrete plan, that everyone must follow for it to succeed. Instead, <strong>everyone is encouraged to work on what they enjoy most!</strong></p>
<p>In consequence, pmOS does not use a regular milestone plan with versions (at least right now). Here is a list with what individuals are working on. <strong>Feel free to add yourself here and what you are interested in</strong> (optionally with priorities and estimated finish date), but you don't have to! If you do, please keep your section of this list updated, and remove finished tasks.</p>
<p><strong>These are all estimations</strong> and the community is expected to understand when something does not work out as planned here. This is a free time project after all, so be grateful, that the individuals step up and share their plans at all.</p>

<p><em>Right now, my primary focus is recruiting more developers by keeping the development enjoyable. Apart from fixing bugs as highest priority, I focus on the following list. Feel free to discuss the importance of these items with me in <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/wiki/Matrix-and-IRC">Matrix/IRC</a> or on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/postmarketOS">/r/postmarketOS</a> (for longer discussions).</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Binary package repository (<a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/64">#64</a>, expecting to have a working version at: <code>2017-08-14</code> - but expect delays due to how fast everything is moving, as said above: helping the others is a higher priority!)</li>
<li>Extend initramfs hooks: allow adding files, multiple hook points (e.g. before and after initramfs-extra was loaded) <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/165">#165</a></li>
<li>Run the <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/tree/master/test">full testsuite</a> with Travis CI for each commit/PR</li>
<li>Show code coverage in the <code>README.md</code> (with a link to details: which files are not covered by testcases etc.)</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.shellcheck.net/"><code>shellcheck</code></a> for more shell scripts in the repo (maybe for all <code>APKBUILD</code>s?), <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/110">automatically format shell scripts</a></li>
<li>Update the deviceinfo format:</li>
<li>Add more information: <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/58">system partition size</a>, ~~<a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/50">kernel commandline</a>~~</li>
<li>~~Create a reference page in the Wiki~~ pablog <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/wiki/deviceinfo-reference">beat me to it</a>, thanks! :D</li>
<li>Write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">linter</a> for deviceinfo files as part of <code>pmbootstrap</code></li>
<li>Add that linting to the static code analysis script for CI</li>
<li>Various device improvements. I'd like to <em>try out</em> (with no expectations, that this will work anytime soon!) mainline for <code>lg-mako</code> (<a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/91">#91</a>, <a href="https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/12">#12</a>)</li>

<h3>PureTryOut</h3>
<p>In general, get postmarketOS to a ready for daily usage state, in my case getting packages and UI packaged for the end user to install. Right now focus is on:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Packaging Phone UI: Plasma Mobile</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Packaging Phone UI: UBports/Yunit</p>
</li>
</ol>
